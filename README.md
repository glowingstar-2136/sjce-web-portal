## Project Overview
The **SJCE Student Web Portal** is a web application designed for students, staff, and admin users at St. Joseph's College of Engineering. It provides:

- Easy access to student and staff resources
- Dedicated login portals for students, staff, and admin
- A modern and responsive UI
- Quick navigation to different sections of the college portal

This project was built during my internship at **Trios Technologies Pvt Ltd**. Unlike the official portal, this version is cleaner, faster, and more user-friendly.
