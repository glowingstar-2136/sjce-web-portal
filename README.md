# **SJCE Student Web Portal 💻👑**

Welcome to the **St. Joseph's College of Engineering Student Web Portal** – a dedicated portal designed to provide students, staff, and administrators with an efficient and user-friendly way to manage academic activities.  

This portal was developed during my internship at **Trios Technologies Pvt Ltd** to improve the boring official college portal, making it more interactive and functional for students and staff.
